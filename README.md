# European Group Project
 The folder to keep track of our progress and versioning of the .do file

Always remember to PULL the .do file before working on it
and to PUSH your changes when you are done
A track of all edits make will be available in the 'history' tab and on the git.hub page of the repository.

If you do not want to overwrite the existing .do file for everyone, to the top center, left of the 'current repository tab' click on current branch and create a new branch. Now, all files will be updated when switching back and forth from the branch to the main (remember to always pull your changes to avoid losing them) and everyone can compare the two verions, eventually deciding to merge the chainges onto the main branch.
