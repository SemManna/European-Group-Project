**#*** 0 - Installing RD packages / Setting RD data *** 
quietly {
    
** Installing RD packages **
*
* You can find all Stata packages written for RDDs at:
* https://github.com/rdpackages?language=stata
*
* In PS3 we will use 2 RD packages: 
* - *rdrobust*, to compute RD estimates;
* - *rddensity*, to implement manipulation tests 
* necessary to attest the validaty of your RD design.
*rdmulti also useful for RDD with multiple cutoffs and multiple scores (multiple running variables, you can read more in the packages-related articles in Stata journals)
*
* Install *rdrobust*
net install rdrobust, ///
from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdpackages/rdrobust/master/stata") replace
*
* Install *rddensity*
net install rddensity, ///
from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdpackages/rddensity/master/stata") replace
*
* Install *lpdensity*
net install lpdensity, /// 
from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nppackages/lpdensity/master/stata") replace
*
* LPDENSITY: local polynomial smoothing approach;
*
* First, approximate the discontinuous empirical CDF using local polynomial methods, then, employ that smoothed approximation to construct estimators of the distribution function, density function, and higher-order derivatives.
*
* In this class: used for RDDENSITY plot.


** Setting RD data **
*
* Import dataset from *rdrobust*'s repository
use rdrobust_senate.dta, clear
*
* Describe dataset
describe
//for each state vote share of dems in the next election and the margin of victory
*
* Summarize variables of interest
sum vote margin class termshouse termssenate population, sep(2)
*
* CONTEXT! We will estimate incumbency effects through close US Senate races.
//to understand incumbency effect we want to compare individuals very similar to one another --> margin of victory to compare individuals extremely close in their senate race to see if incumbents then get an advantage
*
* NOTE! Within a standard RD design we have:
* Y -> outcome variable;
* X -> running variable;
* T -> treatment variable.
*
* NOTE! In our example:
* Y -> Democratic vote share in t+1;
* X -> Democratic margin of victory in t-1;
* T -> Democrat Incumbent in t.
*
* Generate variables following RD notation
gen Y = vote
gen X = margin
gen T = (margin>0) //treatment, returns 1 or 0
//for convenience and ease of interpretation, set up the dataset in this way
}


**#*** 1 -  Implementing RD design validations *** 1.C AND 1.D 
quietly {

** C1 Discontinuity in treatment at threshold **
quietly {
	
rdplot T X
//plot treatment as a fct of th erunning variable, will visualize drastic discontinuity, here is between winning or losing the election 
//T is in fact discontinuous around the thrashold and then outcome also exibits a discontinuity!
* NOTE! Before proceeding, understand if outcome also exhibits a discontinuity
rdplot Y X
//plot outcome as a function of the running variable, it is assuming a polynomial of order 4 and it seems like there is an incumbency effect at the treshold!
*** TIP! Exhibit both discontinuity graphics.
*
* T-X
rdplot T X, graph_options(title(T-X Discontinuity) legend(off)) 
graph rename T_X, replace
* Y-X
rdplot Y X, graph_options(title(Y-X Discontinuity) legend(off))
graph rename Y_X, replace
* Combine and save
graph combine T_X Y_X
graph export combined_discontinuity_graphs.pdf, replace
*
* TIP! COMBINING GRAPHICS WILL BE USEFUL FOR ITEMS 1.C AND 1.D IN PS3.
*
* rdplot OPTIONS allows you to choose the bins to implement e.g.: option binselect(es) (evenly spaced) or binselect(qsmv) (quantile-spaced)

}

** C2 No discontinuity in baseline covariates at threshold ** //individuals below and above cut-off are equal and can be compared
quietly {
//we show this visually and numerically computing rd estimates
* rdrobust: treatment-effects estimation and inference (Robust RD Estimation using MSE bandwidth selection procedure)
*
* First step:  
rdrobust termshouse X
rdplot termshouse X 
*
rdrobust termssenate X
rdplot termssenate X
*
rdrobust population X
rdplot population X 
*
//rdrobust default cutoff is at 0!
//rdrobust output is a table, look at the coefficient, protocol is usually to provide coeffs using the conventional methods but showing std errors showing the robustness - in PS3 we are asked just to show the conventional ones
//the variables display no statistically significant coefficients at the threshold, which also holds visually
//depending on polynomial fit we may see some sort of jump, which is why computing the coefs with rdrobust is important
*
*
* TIP! Create a RD BALANCE CHECK TABLE to summarize covariate-discontinuities tests, exhibiting betas and p-values stored in *rdrobust* post-estimates.
*
* Understand which post-estimates are available from *rdrobust*
help rdrobust
*
rdrobust Y X

local row = 1
foreach z in `covs' {
    qui rdrobust `z' margin
	mat balance[`row',1] = round(e(tau_cl),.001)
	mat balance[`row',2] = round(e(pv_rb),.001)
	local ++row
}
//tau_cl is the coeff estimate, while pv_rb is the p-value for the coefficient
mat rownames balance = `covs'
mat colnames balance = "RD Effect" "Robust p-val"
mat list balance 
*
* Stata does not save matrices with the dataset!! 
* You can save a matrix if you first convert it to a dataset using svmat. SVMAT
*
* TIP! *svmat* converts matrices into dataframes and vice-versa and stores its columns (svmat takes a matrix as new variables).
*
* It is a useful tool if you wish to construct a table: (1) store results in a matrix, (2) convert matrix onto dataframe, (3) export dataframe as Excel or Tex table.
//EG. frame command to then output that information into a separate dataframe and then output that dataframe into a Tex table!
*
svmat balance

}

** C3 Density of running variable "continuous" at cutoff **
quietly {
//RDDENSITY command does exactly this! Produces a statistic with associated p-value, testing the null hp. that density of the running variable is continuous at the cutoff, for a valid rd we should not reject this null!
rddensity X
*
* NOTE! The null hypothesis of "manipulation" tests is that the density of the running variable is "continuous" at the cutoff. For a valid RD design, you should not have any discontinuity - as it hints for a manipulation of the RD  design - hence, you should not reject the null.

}

** C4 No discontinuity in outcome variable away from threshold **
quietly { //very nice rcap - graph box-like gaph!
//manual computation, note: default cutoff for rdrobust is 0, which is also how running variable is constructed, if margin is positive you are an incumbent becasue you won the elections

* NOTE! To avoid a contamination of the test from treatment, do not use alternative treatment cutoffs. Only placebo cutoffs within your control or treatment sample!
*
* TIP! A standard validation graphic is, to plot betas and CIs of RD estimates in placebo cutoffs - to argue for no discontinuities in your outcome variable away from yout treatment cutoff.

**#*** 4 - Further introduction to *rdrobust* ***
quietly {
//rdrobust chooses optimal bandwidth - yet it should not matter, varying the bandwidth we should still see the effect, robustness check!
** Specifying the main bandwidth (h) used to construct the RD point estimator
* (two values: one below, one above cutoff)
rdrobust Y X, h(20 20)
//look at BW est() !!
* NOTE! Robust RD analyses do not depend on the bandwidths chosen.


** Including covariates **
//we can control for unit-specific charactheristics!
rdrobust Y X, covs(population)
* NOTE! Including covariates does not always lead to improved precision. 
* For example, if the covariates are irrelevant, they can increase your CIs.


** Selecting bandwidth ** 
rdbwselect Y X, all		
//regression discontinuity bandwidth select command! 	
//shows all optimal bandwidths according to different criteria		 
 
** Defining polynomial order a priori ** 
rdrobust Y X, p(1)
rdrobust Y X, p(2)
rdrobust Y X, p(3)
rdrobust Y X, p(4)

rdplot Y X,  p(1) 

** Involved plot with a polynomial of order 1, 
* focused around the cutoff (within the bandwidth):
quietly rdrobust Y X
rdplot Y X if -e(h_l)<= X & X <= e(h_r), binselect(esmv) kernel(triangular) h(`e(h_l)' `e(h_r)') p(1) graph_options(title("RD Plot: U.S. Senate Election Data") ytitle(Vote Share in Election at time t+2) xtitle(Vote Share in Election at time t) graphregion(color(white)))
//issues with overfitting, but the larger the ploynomial order the more conservative our estimate will be! 
//usually, show RD effect assuming polynomial of order 4, change it one above or below and estimate should not vary
}


**#*** 5 - Implementing regression discontinuity rob. checks ***
quietly {
//irrespective of model choices, estimates should not vary
*
* TIP! USEFUL FOR POINT 1.K OF PS3.
*
* NOTE! Robust RD estimates are those that are independent of most RD methodological choices that a researcher can choose.
*
* Common robustness checks are: 
* (1) robustness to exclusion of observations around the cutoff; 
	//not related to modelling choice but to if estimates are driven by 
	//outliers within the support, which shouldn't, estimates should be
	//robust to exclusion of certain observations around the cutoff
* (2) robustness to different bandwidths; 
	//effect relatively constant irrespective of bandwidths
* (3) robustness to different RD populations.
*
* To illustrate how one argues for the (2) robustness to different bandwidths:
*
* Compute alternative bandwidths
rdrobust Y X
di .5*abs(h_l)
di .75*abs(h_l)
di 1.25*abs(h_l)
di 1.5*abs(h_l)
