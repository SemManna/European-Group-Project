*** Problem I - Italy ***

* a) Summary Statistics of Italian Firms in 2008 by sector
summarize if year==2008 & country == "Italy"     
// restricts summary stats to Italy and 2008
by sector: summarize if year==2008 & country == "Italy" 

/*The restriction yields a cross-sectional dataset of 4'324 Italian firms in 2008. The observations for sector n.13 are 3'277 while for 29 are 1'047.
There is no significant loss of information in terms of missing values. 
Classsize indicates the size of the firms, which is a categorical variable rescaled between 1 and 5 to indicate the number of employees 
The mean value for both sectors is around 2, which indicates that the firms considered are relatively small 
and have, on average, between 10 and 29 employees. 
For what concerns the number of workers, in absolute values, we observe that the means show a significant difference, being 27.40 for 
firms in sector 13 versus 117.23 for firms in sector 29. Given the previous observation (size of the firm), this indicates that, in sector 29,
the firms belonging to category 5 (250+ employees) have a number of employees much greater than the firms in sector 13 belonging to the same size class.
Indeed, the maximum value for the number of workers in sector 13 is 1'248, versus 22'639 in sector 29. [plot? Expect skeweness; gini]
To correct for inflation, we prefer to comment on the values attained by real_sales (deflated values) rather than sales (absolute values). 
Real sales amount, in mean values, to 5'164.552 in sector 13 versus 42'093.11 in sector 29, unsurprisingly given the nature of the businesses in the two 
sectors considered, i.e. textile versus manufacturing of motor vehicles. Clearly, we would expect this discrepancy to be present also in the deflated 
values of capital and materials (see table). Analogously, the pattern also holds for real value added, i.e. revenues minus materials, showing a mean value 
of 11'981.93 for sector 29 versus 2'797.121 for sector 13. As opposed to the discrepancy in revenues, the difference between value added appears to be 
smaller probably due to the fact that raw materials in the motor sector are relatively higher.
For what concerns wages, given the higher average number of workers in sector 29, we expect a higher mean value for total wages per firm, 
and indeed we observe mean values of 918.72 in sector 13 and 4117.85 for sector 29. 
[plot??? Max value in 29 huge compared to mean... outlier? How skewed is the data?]

* b) Compare  descriptive statistics for 2008 to the same figures in 2017
by sector: summarize if year==2017 & country == "Italy"     

/*  The restriction yields a cross-sectional dataset of 4'567 Italian firms in 2017. The observations for sector n.13 are 3'387 while for 29 are 1'173.
There is no significant loss of information in terms of missing values. 
The mean value of size_class for both sectors appears to be slighlty lower for both sectors, although still around the value of 2 which indicates
belonging to the class of firms with 10-29 employees, indicating a higher number of small firms, especially in sector 13.
Consistently, also the number of workers per firm appears to decrease, moving from an average value of 27.4 in 2008 to 21.8 in 2017 in sector 13 and from 
117.23 to 106.09 in sector 29. Indeed, we observe that the average value of wages slighlty decreases for sector 13, wheareas it increases in sector 29 by 
1'000'000 euro. 
Average real sales instead decrease for sector 13 from 5'164.55 to 4'240.52 thousands of euros. For sector 29, they increase from 42'093.11 to 51'886.3 
thousands of euros. 
The values of real capital and real raw materials decrease in the textile sector while slightly increase in the motor sector. 
Real value added decreases from 2797.12 in sector 13 in 2008 to 2407.43 in 2017, while it increases from 11'981.93 to 14'610.17 in sector 29.
